### Sentiment Analysis Using Tweets Mentioning the Dallas Mavericks

I wanted to showcase some skills that I have yet to display in my Data Science portfolio so far.  One of my goals is to find ways where data analytics and data science can help solve problems in the Sport Business realm.

One area that a business involved in sports, especially in professional sprots, is to understand how the customers and fans feel about the team.  One way that this can be done is through Sentiment Analysis of social media channels and seeing the response of the fans through tweets or posts.

In this project, I utilized a dataset that collected tweets that mentioned the 'Dallas Mavericks' for the 2021-22 basketball season.  The data is hosted on kaggle and can be found [HERE](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexhuggler/dallas-mavericks-twitter-data-for-20212022-games)

I broke this project up into 3 components:

1. Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Feature Engineering and Natural Language Processing
3. Classification Modelling using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes

In the end, I was able to predict Positive, Neutral and Negative Sentiment with 84% accuracy using a multi-nomial Logistic Regression model.  Getting, and improving, the accuracy of this model could help a professional sports team, like the Dallas Mavericks, identify users and tweets target future ad campains, or identify negative users to limit their participation at future events.

I conducted this project locally on my computer which forced some limitations on what scale of modelling I could feasibly do on a dataset this size.  In order to build this project up further in the future, I will need to utilize AWS or other big data tools in order to have more options available to hopefully develop a more accurate model.

I really enjoyed this project and showcasing how I can use real-world social media data and turn that into a predictive model that led to some actionable insights that could have a direct, positive impact on the business of a professional sports franchise.
